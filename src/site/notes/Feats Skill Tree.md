### A Guide on using this Skill Tree

Instead of picking features from an essentially random list, you can use this **Feats Skill Tree** to choose features that better relate to your characters proficiencies and skills.

1. Starting at 1st level, you gain 1 **Talent Point**. You gain an additional Talent Point every 4 levels, at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 20th.
2. Using your **Talent Point,** you can choose a Feat on the skill tree from *a base skill that you are proficient with.*
3. Then, upon earning another **Talent Point**, you can either choose a branch of that same tree, or choose another skill. 
4. Each branch has 2 levels, plus a **Finale** skill that grants even more special abilities.
5. Every 4 levels, you may also swap your **Ability Score Increases** (ASI's) for 1 **Talent Point** instead. *For example, at level 4, you could have 1 **Talent Point** and 2 **ASIs**, or 2 **Talent Points** and a single +1 ASI, or even 3 whole **Talent Points**!*

There is a Feat tree tied to each skill, plus non-allocated "Talents", which can be found using the links below, or the available Feats Skill Tree graph.
